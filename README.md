# IAQ-monitoring-system-V2
This is the second version of the indoor air quality monitoring system 

This project aims to design and implement an IoT-based air quality monitoring system using Arduino. The system consists of multiple sensors that measure different gases such as PM2.5, PM10, , CO, CO2, which are the main components of AQI (Air Quality Index) . These sensors will be added to the Arduino board, and the sensor values will be displayed in real-time on an OLED screen. The next step involves integrating the system onto a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to simplify wiring, enhance aesthetics, and maximize user-friendliness. This will make it more accessible to everyone, including those with limited technical expertise. The realtime data from the sensors will then be uploaded to an IOT cloud platform where the data will be visualized into graphs to make it easier for user to check earlier gas concentrations.
